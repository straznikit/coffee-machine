# Coffee Machine Simulator in Python

This Python script simulates a coffee machine, allowing users to select their desired type of coffee, calculating the total cost, accepting payment, and returning change if necessary. The machine also checks if it has enough resources to make the chosen drink and displays a message if it does not.

## Features:

Coffee Selection: Users can choose from a variety of coffee options, each with its own unique flavor and price.

Payment Handling: The script calculates the total cost of the selected coffee and prompts the user to input the amount paid. It then calculates and returns any change due.

Resource Management: The coffee machine tracks its inventory of ingredients (e.g., coffee beans, water, milk) and ensures it has enough resources to fulfill the order. If resources are insufficient, an appropriate message is displayed.

## How to Use:

1. Run the script to start the coffee machine simulator.

2. Follow the prompts to select your desired type of coffee and input the amount paid.

3. The script will calculate the total cost, check resource availability, and dispense the coffee or provide appropriate feedback.

4. Enjoy your freshly brewed coffee!
